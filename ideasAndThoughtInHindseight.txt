hey there, after i finished the task here are some thoughts i have that i didnt manage to implement on time or didnt think of:

1.break container manager into smaller modules for easier reading/managing :
  a.timestamp module-handle all the converts of time stamps and checking of formatTimestamp
  b.printing module-handle all printing of logs and containers.
2.handle alltimes stamps with a dedicated library(most likely there is one).
3.handle the errors more gracefully, im sure if i had more time some errors would be better 
  to deal with on the spot than to throw upwards and print that the operation is unachievable
4.manage a multi container manager system,as of know i implented a "singelton" to check if there was a crash.
  but it should of supported multi mangers instead that each manager logs for diffrent reasons.
  ofcourse containers and logs will belong to a containermanager to avoid confilicts.
5.ask the user if he wants to fix the crash and if so up to what time does he want to log each container.
6.add more functionabilty to the container manager:start/stop/restart containers, add an option to choose 
  when to start logging a container.
